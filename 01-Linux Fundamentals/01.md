# Key Takeaways

## 1. Unix VS Linux

Unix :- Commercial Use (Paid)
Linux :- Open source (Free)

## 2. Linux Components

- Kernal:: Heart of any operating system. Linux kernal name is "Linux Kernal".
- Shell :: Shell is used to interact with hardware with the help of kernal. We write command on shell and then kernal receives that command and runs it and perform operations on the hardware.
- Bootloader :: Responsible to boot operating system files which sits inside the kernal. In Linux, the bootloader name is GRUB (Grand unified bootloader).

## 3. Commands for hardware information

```bash
# All processes
$ top

# Disk (Hard-disk) size
$ df -h

# System's memory usage
$ free -h
```

## 4. Linux File System

In Linux, everything starts from root directory ("/")

```bash
# Go to top
$ cd /

# List all child directory
$ ls

```

Here's a structured table summarizing the purpose and usage of each root-level directory in Linux:

| **Directory**     | **Description**                                                | **Purpose/Usage**                                                                                   |

### Why so many directories?

- **Organized System Structure:** Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS) to ensure a consistent, logical organization of files.
- **Separation of Concerns:** Each directory serves a unique purpose (e.g., binaries, configurations, logs), making it easier to manage and troubleshoot.
- **Security & Permissions:** Different directories have distinct permission models to protect system integrity.
- **Efficient Management:** It allows for better maintenance, automation, and backup strategies by isolating critical components.
